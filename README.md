# The Official Neodev League Repo

## Who are we?

We're a new organization, committed to igniting the engineering passions of high school students through competitive events. Our first event is planned to be hosted this year in October. We are projecting 100-200 passionate participants.
Our organization is focused on sparking collaboration and innovation in high schoolers. Events will allow teams of 8-10 students from various schools in the region to collaborate and create projects.

# More Information to be released soon!

We are gathering contacts from schools all over the WRDSB region. If you are interested in taking your school to Neodev League, shoot us a DM on our instagram - @neodevleague
